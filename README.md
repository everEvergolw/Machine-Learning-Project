# Machine Learning A+ Project: Feature Engineering

Welcome to this project dedicated to Feature Engineering in Machine Learning. The overarching goal of this endeavor is to engineer potent features for predicting traffic volume, leveraging data available from the preceding day.

## Project Overview

Predicting traffic volume is an intricate yet crucial task, finding its significance across urban planning, logistics, infrastructure development, and various other domains. Accurate predictions can guide informed decisions, leading to optimized resource allocation and efficient urban solutions.

This project accentuates the importance of feature engineering in machine learning. It delves deep into the art and science of transforming raw data into informative features, thereby boosting the performance of machine learning models, especially for time-sensitive predictions like traffic volume.

### Dataset

The primary dataset employed in this project is `metro_traffic_15_19.csv`, which encompasses traffic data collated from diverse sources spanning the years 2015 to 2019. Each data entry corresponds to a specific day, setting the stage for predicting the traffic volume for the subsequent day.

### Feature Engineering Techniques

Throughout this venture, a myriad of feature engineering techniques come into play:

- Temporal feature extraction
- Categorical encoding
- Aggregation-based features
- Advanced transformations rooted in domain knowledge

### Key Findings

- **Linear Regression Model**: This model showcases consistent scores. A notable subset of features for this prediction task encompasses `['snow_1h', 'hour_sin,' 'hour_cos']`. These features maintain their prominence even when the feature set extends to seven, suggesting their criticality and hinting at the possibility of dimensionality reduction.
  
- **Random Forest Model**: Compared to the linear regression model, the scores indicate a slight uptick. The feature count is integral to the model's performance. An observed trend is the decrement in the model's relevance and classification prowess with reduced features, while an increment achieves the contrary. The algorithm's stability is rooted in a balanced feature set. The primary challenge orbits around determining the optimal feature count (`m`), an intrinsic parameter for the random forest.

- **Optimal Feature Set**: Inferences drawn from the tests highlight an optimal feature set of seven: `['snow_1h','temp','month_sin','month_cos','day_sin','hour_sin','hour_cos']`.

### How to Dive In

To immerse yourself in the project's methodologies, techniques, and findings, gravitate towards the main codebase. It's imperative to traverse through the data preprocessing stages, feature engineering techniques, and the eventual model evaluations.

### Concluding Remarks

Feature engineering stands as a linchpin in machine learning, holding the power to sway model performance significantly. This project underscores its pivotal role, especially in the domain of time-series predictions like traffic volume forecasting.
