# Machine Learning Project: Feature Engineering

Welcome to the Machine Learning Project dedicated to Feature Engineering. The overarching goal of this project is to engineer potent features for predicting traffic volume, leveraging data available from the preceding day.

## Project Overview

Predicting traffic volume is an intricate endeavor with broad applications, from urban planning and infrastructure development to traffic management. Accurate predictions can guide informed decisions, aiding in efficient resource allocation and optimization.

This project accentuates the importance of feature engineering in machine learning. Crafting pertinent features can enhance the predictive capabilities of machine learning models, especially for time-sensitive predictions like traffic volume.

### Key Findings

- **Linear Regression Model**: The model exhibited consistent scores. The most effective subset of features for this prediction task includes `['snow_1h', 'hour_sin,' 'hour_cos']`. Interestingly, these features retained their significance even when the feature set was expanded to seven, highlighting their importance and also suggesting potential for dimensionality reduction.
  
- **Random Forest Model**: The scores showcased a slight improvement compared to the linear regression model. The number of features plays a pivotal role in the model's performance. As observed, reducing the feature count negatively impacts the model's relevance and classification ability, while increasing them has the opposite effect. However, the algorithm's stability is contingent on a balanced feature set. The prime challenge lies in determining the optimal number of features (`m`), a critical parameter for the random forest.

- **Optimal Feature Set**: Based on the conducted tests, the optimal feature set comprises seven features: `['snow_1h','temp','month_sin','month_cos','day_sin','hour_sin','hour_cos']`.
